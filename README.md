## Description.
### The "Book Search Engine" project was built using the "MERN" ([MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Node](https://nodejs.dev/)) stack, and it uses [GoogleBook API](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/using) to get the desired book. This was another challenging project. In this application, the user is able to search for a book and save or delete a book if the user has signed in.

To use the "`save this book`" and the "`delete this book`" features, the user must "`login`" or "`sign up`" for an account.
